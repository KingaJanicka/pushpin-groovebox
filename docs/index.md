> **Pushpin** is a fully-featured open-source groovebox project by improvisational electronic musician [Kinga Janicka][kinga].

Building upon Kinga's experience in the field performing live improvised techno, Pushpin seeks to marry the versatility of the
award-winning open-source [Surge XT][surge] soft-synth with the form-factor of the Ableton® Push® 2, powered as a standalone unit
by [Raspberry Pi® 5][rpi5].

# Features

- Eight fully-featured synth tracks (one instance of Surge XT per track)
- Dynamic instrument routing directly from the Ableton® Push® 2 for longer effect chains, sends and master effects
- [Overwitch support][overwitch] built-in for routing Elektron® Overbridge 2-compatible devices
- Designed to be used without a laptop on a Raspberry Pi® 5
- Customise Pushpin's layout using a simple JSON-based format
- Use any Surge XT preset or patch
- Built to be extensible and easily fork-able
- Fully-featured sequencer

# What is it?

Pushpin is a Python application that builds heavily upon [Frederick Font][ffont]'s open source [Pysha][pysha] framework by creating
an interface for communicating with [Surge XT][surge] via the [Open Source Control (OSC)][osc_wiki] standard, using
a standard Ableton® Push® 2. It controls 8 instances of Surge XT, and sequences them via either external or built-in sequencer
(coming soon).

This allows an enormous degree of creative expression, with SurgeXT's powerful modules accessible in a ergonomic layout
that's optimised for live performance.

For the cost of an Ableton® Push® 2, a Raspberry Pi 5 and an audio interface (we recommend the [Raspberry Pi DAC+ HAT](https://thepihut.com/products/iqaudio-dac), though it's also compatible with USB audio interfaces), you can have a fully-featured groovebox with powerful features rivalling the most expensive devices on the market. Even better, with a little bit of Python knowledge, you can hack it to do _literally anything you can dream of._

# Surge XT specifications

Pushpin runs a separate instance of Surge XT per instrument track. This means that each instrument track is capable of:

- Two oscillators, two filters and three insert FX per track
- 12 oscillator types
- 12 filter types
- 29 effect types
- Six assignable LFOs/envelopes per track
- Extensive modulation matrix
- Ability to use tracks as sends
