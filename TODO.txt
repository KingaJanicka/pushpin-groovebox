twist is broken on osc1
control-menu does not set properly

Improve visual feedback with buttons
esp the sequencer track buttons

modmatrix should send the mapping as soon as the knob is turned i think

the debug on engine.py for messages sent from submenus looks SUS

This is the config line needed to set smaller blocksize with pw-jack
to be used only once, val=32 in samples
pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.quantum <VALUE> 




TODO: 
For whatever reason not all synth params will update on state load
I think this might have to do with some error regarding the visible/all in osc_device

Locks broke again? IDK why, maybe pad was stuck?


Audio in broken (overwitch)

check if min value of the plock is the knob val
Should be fixed but check to be sure (preset_sel line 330)

vocoder borken, clouds too
needds a reset of held pads on inst change for the sequencer


watchdog: signaling pd... puredata dies???

Something weird is happening with the overwitch-service client when we launch the app
conenctions in audio in device need to happen on knob release

Theres latency but we can work to reduce it later

We need to add some sort of MIDI sync back in. Important if we want to demo it with Rytm
