Costly functions:

All of the drawing functions?
osc_server seems to be pretty minimal
instrument_sel_mode and metro_seq are inside the update_push2_display stack, also pretty minimal compared to the draw calls
metro_sequencer_mode.py:538(update_pads)
get_current_instrument_page_devices
get_current_instrument_device_and_page
