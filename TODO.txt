The GUI for PD nodes needs to be supressed, IDK why the flag isn't working

each PD node comes with connections, they all need to be disconencted by default

twist is broken on osc1
control-menu does not set properly

Improve visual feedback with buttons
esp the sequencer track buttons

modmatrix should send the mapping as soon as the knob is turned i think

With the lift the disconenct in the engine.py doesn't work
I think we should pass the buffer/etc settings ourselves to puredata and see if that helps
