twist is broken on osc1
control-menu does not set properly

the debug on engine.py for messages sent from submenus looks SUS

This is the config line needed to set smaller blocksize with pw-jack
to be used only once, val=32 in samples
pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.quantum <VALUE> 


TODO: 

vocoder borken, clouds too

we need to save state better, main scale/steps in seq should be saved globally somehow?

midi still has weird skips and shit, the way it catches up with jitter or skipped steps is just unaceptable

preset sel needs to be able to save a patch we've changed to a selected pad

being able to select main output would be nice, maybe in options just like midi input

Theres latency but we can work to reduce it later

added label to the menu defs, needs to be documented along with other chagnes like the modmatrix param

the dispatchers in menus should be fixed, there's too many of them ATM
the set_state for OSCControlSwitch, ControlMenu case has some major kludge in it
it's hardcoded to look for the first control for the address, so it knows where to switch
we should add a "address" field somewhere there, that would fix twist/nimbus too I rekon

should look into RT kernel etc for rpi5
