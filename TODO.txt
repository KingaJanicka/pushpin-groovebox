twist is broken on osc1
control-menu does not set properly

Improve visual feedback with buttons
esp the sequencer track buttons

modmatrix should send the mapping as soon as the knob is turned i think

the debug on engine.py for messages sent from submenus looks SUS

This is the config line needed to set smaller blocksize with pw-jack
to be used only once, val=32 in samples
pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.quantum <VALUE> 




TODO: 
For whatever reason not all synth params will update on state load
I think this might have to do with some error regarding the visible/all in osc_device

Locks broke again? IDK why, maybe pad was stuck?

vocoder borken, clouds too

needds a reset of held pads on inst change for the sequencer


watchdog: signaling pd... puredata dies???

Theres latency but we can work to reduce it later

Make scale menu work with those selectable menus so it's easeier to select values
Add visual feedback to scale button

Replace the controls in Scale menu with new menus
update the bit in seq_metro to conform with new format - should read the control value not menu value
make sure it saves and loads proper - should 'just work'


added label to the menu defs, needs to be documented along with other chagnes like the modmatrix param
